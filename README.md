# KrakenSDK
(WARNING: THIS IS OUT OF DATE)
## What is KrakenSDK?
This is the template you would (usually) use to develop an app for the Kraken platform.
## How do I upload my apps?
Currently, there is no official way to upload your apps to the Blocks market.

You can attempt to inject your app directly into the *apps* folder.

## If you're using the SDK.. PLEASE CONTIRUBUTE!
Send us lots of issues please, we need to know what's working and what's not, so even if you're just checking it out, please send an issue.
